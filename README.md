**A Designer who codes** | Inclusive Design for Underserved Communities

I don't design *for* marginalized users—I design *with* them.

When I built [ReentryGuide GR](https://harrygu.art/reentryguide-gr.html), I spent 3 months attending weekly meetings with formerly incarcerated community members before opening Figma. That proximity shaped every design decision.

## What I Do & Study
- **Inclusive Design** — WCAG AA/AAA, cognitive accessibility, designing for users with autism, low digital literacy, and motor disabilities
- **Community-Embedded Research** — Usability testing with marginalized populations, not just personas
- **Design + Development** — Figma → React Native → Shipped
