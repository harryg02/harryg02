**A Designer who codes** | Inclusive Design | A11y

I don't design *for* marginalized users—I design *with* them.

When I built [ReentryGuide GR](https://harrygu.art/reentryguide-gr.html), before opening Figma, I showed up. I attended weekly meetings with formerly incarcerated community members for 3 months. That proximity shaped every design decision.

## What I Do & Study
- **Inclusive Design** — WCAG AA/AAA, cognitive accessibility, designing for users with autism, low digital literacy, and motor disabilities
- **Community-Embedded Research** — Usability testing with marginalized populations, not just personas
- **Design + Development** — Figma → React Native → Shipped
